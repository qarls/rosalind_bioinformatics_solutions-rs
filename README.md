# Rosalind Bioinformatics Stronghold - Personal Rust Solutions

This is my personal solutions to the problems found in [ROSALIND](rosalind.info)'s Bioinformatics Stronghold.
Rosalind itself is normally designed for Python learning, but figured this is a good way to challenge myself and learn Rust.

If you'd like to discuss solutions, you may open a **Discussions** page on this Github repo, I would love to see others' solutions.

## Disclaimer
I am not affliated with ROSALIND.
