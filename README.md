## Intro

This is my personal solutions to the problems found in [ROSALIND](rosalind.info)'s Bioinformatics Stronghold.

Rosalind itself is normally designed for Python learning,
but figured this is a good way to challenge myself and learn Rust (at my current sluggish pace.)

If you'd like to discuss solutions,
you may open a **Discussions** page on this Github repo, I would love to see others' solutions.

## Challenges

In order, the current solutions present.

- DNA (countdna)

## Disclaimer

I am not affliated with ROSALIND.
