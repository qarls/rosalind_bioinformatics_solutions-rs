## Intro

This is my Rust solutions to the problems found in [ROSALIND](https://rosalind.info)'s Bioinformatics Stronghold.

Rosalind itself is normally designed for Python learning,
but figured this is a good way to challenge myself and learn Rust (at my current sluggish pace.)

If you'd like to discuss solutions,
you may open a **Discussions** page on this Github repo, I would love to see others' solutions.

## Challenges

In order, the current challenges done.

- DNA: [countdna](https://github.com/qarls/countdna/tree/master)
- RNA: [dna_to_rna](https://github.com/qarls/dna_to_rna/tree/master)
- REVC: [dna_complement](https://github.com/qarls/dna_complement/tree/master)

## Disclaimer

I am not affliated with ROSALIND.
