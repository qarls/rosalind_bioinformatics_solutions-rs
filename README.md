# Rosalind Bioinformatics Stronghold - Personal Rust Solutions
- date started: 2025-08-26

These are my Rust solutions to the problems found in [ROSALIND](https://rosalind.info)'s Bioinformatics Stronghold.
Currently, all of my solutions use clap.rs (derive) to handle input, either using a file input or args (shelled via `$(cat test.txt)`.)

QC issues are to be expected,
given these are my first set of coding challenges.

If you'd like to discuss solutions,
you may open a **Discussions** page on this Github repo,
I would love to hear thoughts and suggestions.
